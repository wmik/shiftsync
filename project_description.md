# **Priority Soft \- Full-Stack Developer Assessment**

## **Project: ShiftSync — Multi-Location Staff Scheduling Platform**

---

## **Overview**

Build a web-based shift scheduling platform for a fictional restaurant group ("Coastal Eats") that operates **4 locations** across **2 time zones**. The platform must handle the inherent complexity of real-world workforce scheduling while remaining intuitive for both managers and staff.

---

## **Business Context**

Coastal Eats struggles with:

* Staff frequently calling out with no coverage  
* Overtime costs spiraling due to poor visibility  
* Employees complaining about unfair shift distribution  
* Managers at different locations hoarding "good" employees  
* No central view of who's working where and when

Your solution must address these pain points.

---

## **Core Functional Requirements**

### **1\. User Management & Roles**

**Three user types exist:**

| Role | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Admin** | Corporate oversight across all locations |
| **Manager** | Runs one or more specific locations |
| **Staff** | Works shifts at one or more locations |

* Staff members can be certified to work at multiple locations  
* Staff have **skills** (e.g., "bartender", "line cook", "server", "host")  
* Staff have **availability windows** they set themselves (recurring weekly \+ one-off exceptions)  
* Managers can only see/manage locations they're assigned to  
* Admins see everything

---

### **2\. Shift Scheduling**

**Managers must be able to:**

* Create shifts with: location, date/time, required skill, and headcount needed  
* Assign specific staff to shifts manually  
* Publish a week's schedule (making it visible to staff)  
* Unpublish/edit a schedule before a configurable cutoff (default: 48 hours before the shift)

**The system must enforce:**

* No double-booking (same person, overlapping times, even across locations)  
* Minimum **10 hours** between the end of one shift and start of another for the same person  
* Staff can only be assigned to shifts requiring skills they possess  
* Staff can only be assigned to locations they're certified for  
* Staff can only be assigned during their available hours

**When a constraint is violated:**

* The system must **clearly explain which rule was broken and why**  
* The system should **suggest alternatives** when possible (e.g., "Sarah is unavailable, but John and Maria have the required skill and availability")

---

### **3\. Shift Swapping & Coverage**

**Staff can:**

* Request to swap a shift with another qualified staff member  
* Offer a shift up for grabs ("drop request")  
* Pick up available shifts they're qualified for

**Swap/coverage workflow:**

1. Staff A requests swap or drop  
2. If swap: Staff B must accept  
3. Manager must approve the final change  
4. All parties are notified at each step  
5. Original assignment remains until manager approval

**Edge case requirements:**

* If a swap is pending and the manager edits that shift, the swap request should be automatically cancelled with notification  
* A staff member cannot have more than **3 pending swap/drop requests** at once  
* Drop requests expire **24 hours** before the shift starts if unclaimed

---

### **4\. Overtime & Labor Law Compliance**

**The system must track and warn about:**

* Weekly hours approaching **40 hours** (warning at 35+)  
* Daily hours exceeding **8 hours** (warning) or **12 hours** (hard block)  
* **6th consecutive day** worked in a week (warning)  
* **7th consecutive day** worked in a week (requires manager override with documented reason)

**Overtime visualization:**

* Dashboard showing projected overtime costs for the week  
* Highlighting which specific assignments are pushing staff into overtime  
* Ability to see "what-if" impact before confirming an assignment

---

### **5\. Schedule Fairness Analytics**

**The system must provide:**

* Distribution report showing hours assigned per staff member over a selected period  
* "Desirable shift" tracking — shifts on Friday/Saturday evenings are tagged as premium  
* Fairness score showing whether premium shifts are distributed equitably  
* Managers can see which staff members have been under/over-scheduled relative to their stated desired hours

---

### **6\. Real-Time Features**

* When a manager publishes or modifies a schedule, affected staff should see updates **without refreshing**  
* When a swap request is submitted or resolved, relevant parties should be notified **in real-time**  
* An "on-duty now" dashboard showing who is currently clocked into a shift at each location, updating live  
* If two managers try to assign the same staff member simultaneously, one should see a conflict notification immediately

---

### **7\. Notifications & Communication**

* Staff receive notifications for: new shifts assigned, shift changes, swap request updates, schedule published  
* Managers receive notifications for: swap/drop requests needing approval, overtime warnings, staff availability changes  
* Users configure their notification preferences (in-app only, or in-app \+ email simulation)  
* All notifications are persisted and viewable in a notification center with read/unread status

---

### **8\. Calendar & Time Handling**

* All times must be stored and processed correctly regardless of user timezone  
* Users see times displayed **in the location's timezone** for that shift  
* Recurring availability must handle daylight saving time transitions correctly  
* A shift starting at 11pm and ending at 3am must be handled as a single shift (overnight)

---

### **9\. Audit Trail**

* All schedule changes must be logged: who made the change, when, what the before/after state was  
* Managers can view the history of any shift  
* Admins can export audit logs for any date range and location

---

## **Evaluation Scenarios**

The evaluator will test your system with these scenarios (among others):

1. **The Sunday Night Chaos**: A staff member calls out at 6pm Sunday for a 7pm shift. Walk through the fastest path to finding coverage.  
2. **The Overtime Trap**: A manager tries to build a schedule where they don't realize one employee would hit 52 hours. How does the system help?  
3. **The Timezone Tangle**: A staff member is certified at a location in Pacific time and another in Eastern time. They set availability as "9am-5pm". What happens?  
4. **The Simultaneous Assignment**: Two managers both try to assign the same bartender to different locations at the same time. What happens?  
5. **The Fairness Complaint**: An employee claims they never get Saturday night shifts. How does a manager verify or refute this?  
6. **The Regret Swap**: Staff A and B request a swap. The manager hasn't approved it yet. Staff A changes their mind. What are the implications?

---

## **Deliverables**

1. **Working Application** — Deployed to a publicly accessible URL  
2. **Source Code** — Repository with commit history  
3. **Seed Data** — Pre-populated with realistic test data covering edge cases (multiple locations, staff with various skills, existing schedule with some conflicts)  
4. **Brief Documentation** — How to log in as each role, any known limitations, and any assumptions you made where requirements were ambiguous  
5. This should be sent to your hiring managers email before/at the time of the 72 hour deadline

---

## **Evaluation Criteria**

| Area | Weight |
| ----- | ----- |
| Constraint enforcement correctness | 25% |
| Edge case handling | 20% |
| Real-time functionality | 15% |
| User experience & clarity of feedback | 15% |
| Data integrity under concurrent operations | 15% |
| Code organization & maintainability | 10% |

---

## **Intentional Ambiguities**

The following are **deliberately unspecified**. Part of the evaluation is how you choose to handle them:

* What happens to historical data when a staff member is de-certified from a location?  
* How should "desired hours" interact with availability windows?  
* When calculating consecutive days, does a 1-hour shift count the same as an 11-hour shift?  
* If a shift is edited after swap approval but before it occurs, what should happen?  
* How should the system handle a location that spans a timezone boundary (e.g., a restaurant near a state line)?

Document your decisions.
